    "## The problem\n",
    "\n",
    "DonorChoose.org wants to find a solution that \"will enable DonorsChoose.org to build targeted email campaigns recommending specific classroom requests to prior donors\". In any business, one of the greatest revenue-generating segments of customers (or donors) are those who have previously provided revenue. In DonorsChoose.org's case, previous donors already shown a preference for the product and have an email that they can be contacted through. In the EDA stage, the effect of re-engaged customers on the bottom line is quantified. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary focus of this kernel is to generate a solution that will match previous donors to projects that they will likely make donatations toward. \n",
    "\n",
    "The three target metrics for the solution are:\n",
    "* Performance - Good Targeting\n",
    "* Adaptable - Feasable Implementation\n",
    "* Intelligible - Easily Understandable\n",
    "\n",
    "## The approach\n",
    "\n",
    "By framing the solution as a \"Recommender System\", there is already a firm foundation of work on which the project can be based. This problem varies from the typical recommender system. Two key differences are: donors tend to \"make a single purchase\" (donate to a single project) and there are a significant amount of products (projects) that have only one to three donors. This can complicate the more standard recommendation approaches. Therefore, the approach I decided to take was to recommend new projects based both upon features of users and features of projects. Many several new features have been engineered from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to begin is to use the data to give a brief overview of the company and the problem we wish to solve using the data we have been provided. Perhaps the most important metrics for any large company is the bottom line, so this kernel begins with examining income and a sucessful solutions possible impact on income. "
